### Acknowledgement of Country

:::

::: {.column width="65%"}

I would like to acknowledge that today I'm presenting this topic from Kaurna Country.<br><br>

I acknowledge the deep feelings of attachment and relationship of the Kaurna people to their Place.<br><br>

I also pay respects to the cultural authority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples from other areas of Australia online today, and pay my respects to Elders past, present and emerging.

::: {.notes}
I also wish to express my gratitude for being involved in this space, and an awareness of the trust that has been placed in me

## Who Am I? 

- Oldest person in Black Ochre Data Labs but still an ECR

. . .

- Unintentionally took the "winding path" approach to my PhD (2008-2018)
    + Undertaken in a T Cell  / Autoimmunity Research Group
    + Developed a novel Bayesian Statistical model for alternate transcript detection (using microarrays)

. . . 

- Co-ordinator of the University of Adelaide Bioinformatics Hub (2014-2020)
    + Analysed dozens of RNA-Seq datasets (+ more)
    + Developed multiple training workshops and undergrad/postgrad courses

. . .     
    
- Massive R nerd (5 Bioconductor packages)
    

::: {.notes}
- PhD was working in a T cell group looking at autoimmune disease
- Developed a Bayesian model for detection of alternate transcript expression
- Am the lead developer for two Bioconductor packages and have contributed to 3 more
- Currently sit on the Community Advisory Boards for Bioconductor

:::

## Who Am I? 

- First discovered microarray data and R in 2002
    + Most statistical understanding has been learned through this lens
    + Primary training is in biology (e.g. genetics, biochemistry)

. . .

- Majority of experience in bulk tissue (i.e. not single-cell)

. . .

- Also spent two years researching ER-dependent Breast Cancers
    + Looking at Transcription Factors (ChIP-Seq)
    + Data Integration (RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, HiC etc)

::: {.notes}
- Statistical training has been very different to epidemiology & study design

# Why Transcriptomics? {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## Why?

- Transcriptomics is essentially the analysis of RNA
- Provides insight into a **highly dynamic** component of biology
- Long history of identifying biomarkers and establishing mechanisms
    - Is essentially a hypothesis-generating step
    - Often need to test hypotheses using conventional experimental approaches
    
## Why?

PROPHECY $\implies$ Preventing Renal OPHtalmic Events in CommunitY

. . .

- Key focus is Type 2 Diabetes and complications (CVD and CKD)

. . .

- Multiple 'omics layers: DNA (Genomics), DNA-methylation (EpiGenomics), protein (Proteomics) etc

. . .

- Whole blood $\implies$ large immune component ("white blood cells")
- Can we see markers of the different stages of Type 2 Diabetes <br>(i.e. complications developing)
    
. . . 

- By integrating with other -omics layers:
    + Can we establish clear hypotheses into underlying mechanisms? <br>$\implies$ clinical intervention
    
::: {.notes}
- Also have lipidomics, metabolomics, retinal scans, ECGs, imflammatory markers

# How Does Biology Even Work? {background-color="#3c3c44"}

## DNA

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width='44%'}

- Most are familiar with DNA
- Directly inherited from parents<br>$\implies$ unique people
- Same in every cell
- Stays in the nucleus
- Generally static
    + Until cell division

:::

::: {.column width='56%'}

:::

:::

::: {.notes}
- Most of us a familiar with DNA
- We all have our own unique DNA, passed down from our parents
- DNA lives in the nucleus of most cells
- Chromosomes replicate and divide with cell division
:::

## DNA

- Each chromosome is a string of millions of sub-molecules:
    + i.e. nucleotides: A, C, G, T
    + Double-stranded molecule, i.e. double helix
    
. . .    
    
- Changes in individual positions (or larger groups of positions) are uniquely ours
    + Inherited from parents (+ a few spontaneous changes)
    
. . .    
    
- We often refer to these unique positions as *variants*
    + Single nucleotides (SNVs), missing/extra nucleotides (InDels) 
    + Larger structural variants (SVs) and repetitive elements (REs)
- Collections of variants within a population $\implies$ *genetic diversity*

::: {.notes}
- Full names for bases Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine
- I have a mutation in my haemoglobin not shared by either parent
    + My HbA1c cannot be measured, wheareas both of theirs can
    + My blood responds poorly to low-oxygen situations: like respiratory infections
:::


## DNA

::: {.notes}
- Beyond cell division, DNA just hangs out, chillin' in every nucleus
- Is a largely static and stable molecule
- Lots of activity on it and around it (methylation, transcription factors, 3D conformation etc)
- Can almost be considered as a giant set of personalised instructions

:::

## DNA

::: {.notes}
- We all share many common sequence runs in our DNA, but at some positions we may tend to differ
- These are known as 'variants' but in reality this variation is what we refer to as 'genetic diversity'
