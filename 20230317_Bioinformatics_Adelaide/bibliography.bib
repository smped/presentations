  abstract = "New normal linear modeling strategies are presented for analyzing
              read counts from RNA-seq experiments. The voom method estimates
              the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a
              precision weight for each observation and enters these into the
              limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This opens access for
              RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology developed for
              microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom performs as well
              or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are
              generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods.

  author   = "McCarthy, Davis J and Smyth, Gordon K",
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Statistical methods are used to test for the
              differential expression of genes in microarray experiments. The
              most widely used methods successfully test whether the true
              differential expression is different from zero, but give no
              assurance that the differences found are large enough to be
              biologically meaningful. RESULTS: We present a method, t-tests
              relative to a threshold (TREAT), that allows researchers to test
              formally the hypothesis (with associated p-values) that the
              differential expression in a microarray experiment is greater
              than a given (biologically meaningful) threshold. We have
              evaluated the method using simulated data, a dataset from a
              quality control experiment for microarrays and data from a
              biological experiment investigating histone deacetylase
              inhibitors. When the magnitude of differential expression is
              taken into account, TREAT improves upon the false discovery rate
              of existing methods and identifies more biologically relevant
              genes. AVAILABILITY: R code implementing our methods is

@ARTICLE{Wilson2019-ln,
  title    = "The harmonic mean \textit{p}-value for combining dependent tests",
  author   = "Wilson, Daniel J",
  abstract = "Analysis of ``big data'' frequently involves statistical
              comparison of millions of competing hypotheses to discover hidden
              processes underlying observed patterns of data, for example, in
              the search for genetic determinants of disease in genome-wide
              association studies (GWAS). Controlling the familywise error rate
              (FWER) is considered the strongest protection against false
              positives but makes it difficult to reach the multiple
              testing-corrected significance threshold. Here, I introduce the
              harmonic mean p-value (HMP), which controls the FWER while
              greatly improving statistical power by combining dependent tests
              using generalized central limit theorem. I show that the HMP
              effortlessly combines information to detect statistically
              significant signals among groups of individually nonsignificant
              hypotheses in examples of a human GWAS for neuroticism and a
              joint human-pathogen GWAS for hepatitis C viral load. The HMP
              simultaneously tests all ways to group hypotheses, allowing the
              smallest groups of hypotheses that retain significance to be
              sought. The power of the HMP to detect significant hypothesis
              groups is greater than the power of the Benjamini-Hochberg
              procedure to detect significant hypotheses, although the latter
              only controls the weaker false discovery rate (FDR). The HMP has
              broad implications for the analysis of large datasets, because it
              enhances the potential for scientific discovery.",

              (ER)-$\alpha$-positive breast cancer is controversial,

              diverse, clinically relevant panel of cell-line and
              patient-derived models, we demonstrate that AR activation, not
              suppression, exerts potent antitumor activity in multiple disease
              contexts, including resistance to standard-of-care ER and CDK4/6
              inhibitors. Notably, AR agonists combined with standard-of-care
              agents enhanced therapeutic responses. Mechanistically, agonist
              activation of AR altered the genomic distribution of ER and
              essential co-activators (p300, SRC-3), resulting in repression of
              ER-regulated cell cycle genes and upregulation of AR target
              genes, including known tumor suppressors. A gene signature of AR
              activity positively predicted disease survival in multiple
              clinical ER-positive breast cancer cohorts. These findings
              provide unambiguous evidence that AR has a tumor suppressor role
              in ER-positive breast cancer and support AR agonism as the
              optimal AR-directed treatment strategy, revealing a rational
              therapeutic opportunity.",
