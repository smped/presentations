  abstract = "Expanded carrier screening (ECS) for recessive monogenic diseases
              requires prior knowledge of genomic variation, including DNA
              variants that cause disease. The composition of pathogenic
              variants differs greatly among human populations, but
              historically, research about monogenic diseases has focused
              mainly on people with European ancestry. By comparison, less is
              known about pathogenic DNA variants in people from other parts of
              the world. Consequently, inclusion of currently underrepresented
              Indigenous and other minority population groups in genomic
              research is essential to enable equitable outcomes in ECS and
              other areas of genomic medicine. Here, we discuss this issue in
              relation to the implementation of ECS in Australia, which is
              currently being evaluated as part of the national Government's
              Genomics Health Futures Mission. We argue that significant effort
              is required to build an evidence base and genomic reference data
              so that ECS can bring significant clinical benefit for many
              Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Australians. These
              efforts are essential steps to achieving the Australian
              Government's objectives and its commitment ``to leveraging the
              benefits of genomics in the health system for all Australians.''
              They require culturally safe, community-led research and
              community involvement embedded within national health and medical
              genomics programs to ensure that new knowledge is integrated into
              medicine and health services in ways that address the specific
              and articulated cultural and health needs of Indigenous people.
              Until this occurs, people who do not have European ancestry are
              at risk of being, in relative terms, further disadvantaged.",

              structures, typically consisting of a sequence graph, to mitigate

              pantranscriptome: a population-level transcriptomic reference.
              Our toolchain, which consists of additions to the VG toolkit and
              a standalone tool, RPVG, can construct spliced pangenome graphs,
              map RNA sequencing data to these graphs, and perform
              haplotype-aware expression quantification of transcripts in a
              pantranscriptome. We show that this workflow improves accuracy
              over state-of-the-art RNA sequencing mapping methods, and that it
              can efficiently quantify haplotype-specific transcript expression

  abstract = "The Human Reference Genome serves as the foundation for modern
              genomic analyses. However, in its present form, it does not
              adequately represent the vast genetic diversity of the human
              population. In this study, we explored the consensus genome as a
              potential successor of the current reference genome and assessed
              its effect on the accuracy of RNA-seq read alignment. To find the
              best haploid genome representation, we constructed consensus
              genomes at the pan-human, superpopulation, and population levels,
              using variant information from The 1000 Genomes Project
              Consortium. Using personal haploid genomes as the ground truth,
              we compared mapping errors for real RNA-seq reads aligned to the
              consensus genomes versus the reference genome. For reads
              overlapping homozygous variants, we found that the mapping error
              decreased by a factor of approximately two to three when the
              reference was replaced with the pan-human consensus genome. We
              also found that using more population-specific consensuses
              resulted in little to no increase over using the pan-human
              consensus, suggesting a limit in the utility of incorporating a
              more specific genomic variation. Replacing the reference with
              consensus genomes impacts functional analyses, such as
              differential expressions of isoforms, genes, and splice

  abstract = "Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq is one of the most
              commonly performed bioinformatics analyses. Transcript-level
              quantifications are inherently more uncertain than gene-level
              read counts because of ambiguous assignment of sequence reads to
              transcripts. While sequence reads can usually be assigned
              unambiguously to a gene, reads are very often compatible with
              multiple transcripts for that gene, particularly for genes with
              many isoforms. Software tools designed for gene-level
              differential expression do not perform optimally on transcript
              counts because the read-to-transcript ambiguity (RTA) disrupts
              the mean-variance relationship normally observed for gene level
              RNA-seq data and interferes with the efficiency of the empirical
              Bayes dispersion estimation procedures. The pseudoaligners
              kallisto and Salmon provide bootstrap samples from which
              quantification uncertainty can be assessed. We show that the
              overdispersion arising from RTA can be elegantly estimated by
              fitting a quasi-Poisson model to the bootstrap counts for each
              transcript. The technical overdispersion arising from RTA can
              then be divided out of the transcript counts, leading to scaled
              counts that can be input for analysis by established gene-level
              software tools with full statistical efficiency. Comprehensive
              simulations and test data show that an edgeR analysis of the
              scaled counts is more powerful and efficient than previous
              differential transcript expression pipelines while providing
              correct control of the false discovery rate. Simulations explore
              a wide range of scenarios including the effects of paired vs

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The accuracy of transcript quantification using
              RNA-seq data depends on many factors, such as the choice of
              alignment or mapping method and the quantification model being
              adopted. While the choice of quantification model has been shown
              to be important, considerably less attention has been given to
              comparing the effect of various read alignment approaches on
              quantification accuracy. RESULTS: We investigate the influence of
              mapping and alignment on the accuracy of transcript
              quantification in both simulated and experimental data, as well
              as the effect on subsequent differential expression analysis. We
              observe that, even when the quantification model itself is held
              fixed, the effect of choosing a different alignment methodology,
              or aligning reads using different parameters, on quantification
              estimates can sometimes be large and can affect downstream
              differential expression analyses as well. These effects can go
              unnoticed when assessment is focused too heavily on simulated
              data, where the alignment task is often simpler than in
              experimentally acquired samples. We also introduce a new
              alignment methodology, called selective alignment, to overcome
              the shortcomings of lightweight approaches without incurring the
              computational cost of traditional alignment. CONCLUSION: We
              observe that, on experimental datasets, the performance of
              lightweight mapping and alignment-based approaches varies
              significantly, and highlight some of the underlying factors. We
              show this variation both in terms of quantification and
              downstream differential expression analysis. In all comparisons,
              we also show the improved performance of our proposed selective
              alignment method and suggest best practices for performing
              RNA-seq quantification.",
