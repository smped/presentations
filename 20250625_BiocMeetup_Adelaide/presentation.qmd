## A Brief Personal History

- First encountered `limma` & R v1.5.? in Nov 2002
- PhD 2008-2018 $\implies$ developed an (unpublished) microarray package
    + No `RStudio`, No `Rcpp`, No `tidyverse`
    + MCMC engine written in `C` $\implies$ using `.Call()`

:::


::: {.fragment}

- No-one in Adelaide knew how to make `R` talk to `C` (~2009)
    + Attended UseR (Coventry, 2011)
    + Started Adelaide R Users Group (~2012, Gary Glonek & Jono Tuke)
    
:::

::: {.fragment}
    
- Looked the distant Bioconductor Community with awe
    + No connection to the community in Adelaide $\implies$ only WEHI in Australia
    + Tiny Adelaide bioinformatics community in 2008 (Greg Goodall, Simon Barry, Jozef Gecz)
    
:::

::: {.notes}
- Attending UseR was my best attempt at finding help & support
    + Was lucky enough to be the moment JJ Allaire launched RStudio
- Stopped attending User Group after 12 months as I'd returned to guitar teaching
:::


## A Brief Personal History

::: {.notes}
- Was probably asked to apply by Gary because I'd started the User Group & I'd tutored stats for him
- Never had any bioinformatics mentorship or trained with someone with more experience than me
- To complete the picture of perfection: I was also homeless
- Within DVCR I answered to Kerry Jaeger who was extremely supportive through out entire existence
- Wasn't out as Non-Binary yet $\implies$ my most striking experience of male privilege
- No idea how to write a Bioc package. Didn't know anyone else in Adelaide who did
:::

- Was offered position in 2014 to start Bioinformatics Hub at University of Adelaide
    + 1 Yr contract (DVCR funded project)
    + No PhD (until 2018)
    + No experience in academia
    + Never seen a FastQ file or used an HPC
    
::: {.incremental}
    
- Build bioinformatics capacity in Adelaide
    + White, mid-40s & male [$\implies$ everyone assumed I knew what I was talking about]{.fragment}
    + Fumbled & stumbled early $\implies$ eventually found our way [(Hien + Jimmy joined 2015)]{.fragment}

:::  
  
::: {.fragment}
- Started helping with BiocAsia in 2016
:::

::: {.fragment}

- Developed both `strandcheckR` & `ngsReports`
    + 2018-2019: Chris Ward & Hien To

:::





## More Recently

::: {.notes}
- I believe many of Kerry's projects within DVCR were no longer supported & she retired
:::

- Bioinformatics Hub was closed in 2020
    + Change in DVCR (Anton Middelberg appointed in 2019)

::: {.fragment}

- 2020 - 2022: Dame Roma Mitchell Cancer Research Labs
    + Worked on ChIP-Seq + multiomics of Breast Cancer
    + Developed `extraChIPs`

![](https://smped.github.io/extraChIPs/reference/figures/extraChIPs.png){.absolute right=200 top=200 width='150px'}

:::

::: {.fragment}
    
- 2022 - 2025: Black Ochre Data Labs
    + PROPHECY: Type 2 Diabetes + Vascular complications in Indigenous Australians
    + Working on transcriptomics layer (~1200 libraries)
    + Cohort-level analysis $\implies$ Cohort-level multiomics

<br>

- Really pleased we now have multiple Bioc developers in Adelaide
:::
  
## The Community Advisory Board {background-image=https://blog.bioconductor.org/posts/2025-03-05-CAB/CAB-map-2025.png background-size="90%"  background-position='40% 65%'}

- I joined the Bioconductor Community Advisory Board (CAB) in late 2023

::: {.notes}

- A CAB term is 3 years
- Don't know when to shut-up so have found myself as Co-Chair with Janani & Lori as Secretary
- CAB nominations are now open
- Looking for better representation from Central/Southern America, Asia & within Industry

## Bioconductor As An Organisation


1. Scientific Advisory Board: https://bioconductor.org/about/scientific-advisory-board/
2. Technical Advisory Board: https://bioconductor.org/about/technical-advisory-board/
    + Currently no Australian representation
3. Community Advisory Board: https://bioconductor.org/about/community-advisory-board/

. . .

- The Core Team is currently 6 people: https://bioconductor.org/about/core-team/
    + Maria Doyle (Limerick, Ireland) as the Bioconductor Community Manager

. . .

- Multiple active Bioconductor working groups: https://workinggroups.bioconductor.org/currently-active-working-groups-committees.html
    + Resource Translation, Social Media, Package Review, Workflows/Publications, RLadies etc
    + Great way to contribute [$\implies$ can also be beneficial for career]{.fragment}
 

## Workflows Working Group (sic) Update

::: {.notes}

- Discovered when Nora was putting one together for `sSNAPPY`
- Are also contemplating changing the name on Bioc: Playbooks? Tutorials?
    + Trying to avoid confusion with snakemake, nextflow etc
    
:::

- Workflows are a special type of package $\implies$ extended tutorials
    + Reflect key decision making steps
    + Integration across multiple packages
    + No package building time-limits
    
. . .    
    
- Used to be an F1000R 'pipeline' giving an indexed DOI for a Bioc workflow
    + Submit $\LaTeX$ document with workflow $\implies$ published on both Bioconductor & F100R
    + F1000R now require MS Word documents $\implies$ pipeline is broken
    
. . .    
    
- Being addressed by Charlotte Soneson, Mike Love, Susan Holmes, Laurent Gatto, Lori Shepherd, Vince Carey, Sean Davis, Davide Risso + me (with raging imposter syndrome)

## Workflows Working Group (sic) Update

::: {.notes}

- JOSE/JOSS etc are well down the track to being indexed publications
    + Mike has figured out how to manually add these to PubMed
    
:::

- Relationship now established with Journal of Open Source Education (Lorena Barba)
- Workflow initially reviewed in-house
    + Need a team of internal Bioconductor reviewers
    + Developing key assessment criteria & checklist for reviewers
    + Needs to satisfy JOSE standards

. . .
    
- Then fast-tracked within JOSE if wanted
    + Have established a team of Bioc Editors at JOSE
    + Mike, Laurent, Vince, Charlotte



## The Bioconductor Community

::: {.notes}
- Bioc has always been strongly DEI $\implies$ impacts on funding are unclear
    + 2/6 Core Team members prefer They/Them
    + Software Carpentries are already feeling the anti-DEI threat
- Many contributors are immigrants to the USA

:::

- Bioconductor officially left Twitter in late 2023
    + Staying was considered a breach of the Bioc Code of Conduct
    + Community hasn't really reformed on Mastodon or BlueSky

. . .

- The Bioconductor Slack has been effectively archived
    + Community now on Zulip
    + Is the social media era over?
- Support site is still quite active
  
. . .

- BiocAsia feels like it's at a crossroads $\implies$ not BiocAustralia

. . .

- Attendance at Bioc (USA) not viable for many
    + UK also becoming hostile to gender diverse community
    
. . .

- US researchers are having a very tough time $\implies$ keeping their heads down



## The Bioconductor Community

- What does this mean for us?

. . .

#### Discussion Questions:

- Is social media over and what does this mean for the Bioconductor Community
- Role, need and strategy for BiocAsia?
    + Ellis Patrick (USyd) already proposed a Zoom Seminar Series
- What stages of our career did we feel most alone & needing help?
    + Early tutorials? Package Development?
    + What do we think is most helpful across key career stages?
- Could smaller meetups be a good strategy for the Asia/Pacific or globally?
    + Is there even a need? Are we all doing OK?
- Do we need more training as a local/national community?
