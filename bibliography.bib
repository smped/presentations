    abstract = {Analysis of numerous RNA-seq datasets reveals a recurrent sample-specific length bias that causes frequent false positive calls by gene-set enrichment analyses, leading to functional misinterpretation of the data. Its removal requires methods that allow the integration of gene length as sample-specific covariate.},
