  abstract = "MOTIVATION: Statistical methods are used to test for the
              differential expression of genes in microarray experiments. The
              most widely used methods successfully test whether the true
              differential expression is different from zero, but give no
              assurance that the differences found are large enough to be
              biologically meaningful. RESULTS: We present a method, t-tests
              relative to a threshold (TREAT), that allows researchers to test
              formally the hypothesis (with associated p-values) that the
              differential expression in a microarray experiment is greater
              than a given (biologically meaningful) threshold. We have
              evaluated the method using simulated data, a dataset from a
              quality control experiment for microarrays and data from a
              biological experiment investigating histone deacetylase
              inhibitors. When the magnitude of differential expression is
              taken into account, TREAT improves upon the false discovery rate
              of existing methods and identifies more biologically relevant
              genes. AVAILABILITY: R code implementing our methods is

  author   = "Law, Charity W and Chen, Yunshun and Shi, Wei and Smyth, Gordon K",
  abstract = "New normal linear modeling strategies are presented for analyzing
              read counts from RNA-seq experiments. The voom method estimates
              the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a
              precision weight for each observation and enters these into the
              limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline. This opens access for
              RNA-seq analysts to a large body of methodology developed for
              microarrays. Simulation studies show that voom performs as well
              or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are
              generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods.

    abstract = "{Between-sample normalization is a critical step in genomic data analysis to remove systematic bias and unwanted technical variation in high-throughput data. Global normalization methods are based on the assumption that observed variability in global properties is due to technical reasons and are unrelated to the biology of interest. For example, some methods correct for differences in sequencing read counts by scaling features to have similar median values across samples, but these fail to reduce other forms of unwanted technical variation. Methods such as quantile normalization transform the statistical distributions across samples to be the same and assume global differences in the distribution are induced by only technical variation. However, it remains unclear how to proceed with normalization if these assumptions are violated, for example, if there are global differences in the statistical distributions between biological conditions or groups, and external information, such as negative or control features, is not available. Here, we introduce a generalization of quantile normalization, referred to as smooth quantile normalization (qsmooth), which is based on the assumption that the statistical distribution of each sample should be the same (or have the same distributional shape) within biological groups or conditions, but allowing that they may differ between groups. We illustrate the advantages of our method on several high-throughput datasets with global differences in distributions corresponding to different biological conditions. We also perform a Monte Carlo simulation study to illustrate the bias-variance tradeoff and root mean squared error of qsmooth compared to other global normalization methods.

@article{Hickey2021,
abstract = {The role of the androgen receptor (AR) in estrogen receptor (ER)-$\alpha$-positive breast cancer is controversial, constraining implementation of AR-directed therapies. Using a diverse, clinically relevant panel of cell-line and patient-derived models, we demonstrate that AR activation, not suppression, exerts potent antitumor activity in multiple disease contexts, including resistance to standard-of-care ER and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Notably, AR agonists combined with standard-of-care agents enhanced therapeutic responses. Mechanistically, agonist activation of AR altered the genomic distribution of ER and essential co-activators (p300, SRC-3), resulting in repression of ER-regulated cell cycle genes and upregulation of AR target genes, including known tumor suppressors. A gene signature of AR activity positively predicted disease survival in multiple clinical ER-positive breast cancer cohorts. These findings provide unambiguous evidence that AR has a tumor suppressor role in ER-positive breast cancer and support AR agonism as the optimal AR-directed treatment strategy, revealing a rational therapeutic opportunity. Functional interplay of sex hormones in estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer unveils the therapeutic potential of androgen receptor agonists.},
